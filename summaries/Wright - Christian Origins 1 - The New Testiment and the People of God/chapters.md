### Preface

-   Wright explains his ambition to write not just on Jesus and Paul but on the New Testament as a whole, leading to a five-volume plan.
-   He laments the brevity of most one- or two-volume “New Testament theologies” and commits to engaging major debates in depth.

### Chapter 1: Christian Origins and the New Testament

-   Differentiates between the study of Christian origins (the historical Jesus and early church) and New Testament studies (the texts as they stand).
-   Argues both disciplines require a prior grasp of first-century Judaism and must conclude with theological and practical reflections.
-   Describes how these overlaps drove the creation of a multi-volume series rather than isolated monographs.

### Chapter 2: The World of Second-Temple Judaism

-   Surveys the political, social and religious landscape of Judaism in Palestine under Persian, Hellenistic and Roman rule.
-   Explores various sects (Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes), their hopes for God’s kingdom, and the impact of Roman imperial cults.
-   Demonstrates how Jewish symbols and high-stakes hopes shaped early Christian self-understanding.

### Chapter 3: God and the People of God

-   Examines Old Testament and Jewish conceptions of “God” and “people of God,” including covenantal language.
-   Shows how early Christians inherited and repurposed these terms, re-defining “God,” “Lord,” and “Christ” in light of Jesus’s life, death and resurrection.

### Chapter 4: The Literary Shape of the New Testament

-   Outlines the genres within the New Testament—Gospel narrative, Pauline letters, Catholic epistles, apocalypse—and their first-century contexts.
-   Discusses authorship, audience and occasion, emphasising how form shapes theological message.
-   Offers hermeneutical principles for reading these diverse texts in relation to their Judaeo-Roman milieu.

### Chapter 5: Theology and Practice in the Earliest Churches

-   Draws together historical and literary strands to reflect on key themes: kingdom of God, salvation, faith, righteousness, community.
-   Considers how early Christian practice (baptism, Eucharist, missionary activity) flows from these theological convictions.
-   Prepares the ground for the next volumes on Jesus and Paul by showing the lived reality of the New Testament message.
