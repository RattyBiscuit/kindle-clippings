> The proper context for interpreting the Bible is the context of the biblical writers-the context that produced the Bible.1 Every other context is alien to the biblical writers and, therefore, to the Bible. Yet there is a pervasive tendency in the believing Church to filter the Bible through creeds, confessions, and denominational preferences.

> "Only begotten" is an unfortunately confusing translation, especially to modern ears. Not only does the translation "only begotten" seem to contradict the obvious statements in the Old Testament about other sons of God, it implies that there was a time when the Son did not exist-that he had a beginning. The Greek word translated by this phrase is monogenes. It doesn't mean "only begotten" in some sort of "birthing" sense. The confusion extends from an old misunderstanding of the root of the Greek word. For years monogenes was thought to have derived from two Greek terms, monos ("only") and gennao ("to beget, bear"). Greek scholars later discovered that the second part of the word monogenes does not come from the Greek verb gennao, but rather from the noun genos ("class, kind"). The term literally means "one of a kind" or "unique" without connotation of created origin. Consequently, since Jesus is indeed identified with Yahweh and is therefore, with Yahweh, unique among the elohim that serve God, the term monogenes does not contradict the Old Testament language.

> We can see that the tasks of humanity, taken in tandem with the earlier observations that require Eden and Earth to be distinct, distinguish Eden and the earth. It makes no sense to subdue the garden of God. It's already what God wants it to be. There's no place on Earth like it. If it needed subjugation, that would imply imperfection. That's something that cannot be said about Eden, but it's true of the rest of the world. For sure God was happy with the whole creation. He pronounced it "very good" (Gen 1:31). But "very good" is not perfect.1 Lastly, Eden and Earth must be distinct since, after the fall, Adam and Eve are expelled from it and have to live elsewhere. Unless you believe that they were sent into outer space, you must acknowledge Eden and Earth as distinct. Observing this distinction affects a range of biblical concepts and provides solutions to a few thorny theological problems. But I'm only concerned with one issue here. The distinction helps us see that the original task of humanity was to make the entire Earth like Eden.

> But the Spirit is not the only influence. The experiences of our lives involve other imagers, both good and evil, including divine imagers we cannot see. The worldview of the biblical author was an animate one, where the members of the unseen world interact with humans. Loyal members of God's "congregation" (council), sent to minister to us (Heb 1:14), have embraced God's Edenic vision-we are brothers and sisters (Heb 2:10-18).

> Genesis 1 and 2 don't provide the Bible's only creation story. Psalm 74 describes creation as well-as Yahweh's victory over the forces of primeval chaos. Yahweh brought the world into order, making it habitable for humanity, his people as it were. The creation act as described in Psalm 74 was theologically crucial for establishing Yahweh's superiority over all other gods. Baal was not king of the gods, as the Ugaritic story proclaimed-Yahweh was.

> Genesis 3-11 makes it clear that humanity failed miserably. Free will in the hands of imperfect beings comes with that risk. But the incident at Babel, foolish and self-willed as it was, shows us that there's an Edenic yearning in the human heart, a desire for utopia and a sense of divine presence. But God would not trade his own version of Eden for humanity's.

> A second Sinai passage that is a key text for connecting the law and the heavenly host is Deuteronomy 33:1-4. The Septuagint version has a multitude of divine beings at Sinai whereas the traditional Hebrew text does not. That isn't the only divergence, either. Take a look at the passage in both versions, especially the underlined words:7 Traditional (Masoretic) Hebrew Text Septuagint Now this is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the Israelites before his death. Then he said, "Yahweh came from Sinai, and he dawned upon them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran, and he came with myriads of holy ones, at his right hand a fiery law for them. Moreover, he loves his people, all the holy ones were in your hand, and they bowed down to your feet, each one accepted directions from you. A law Moses instructed for us, as a possession for the assembly of Jacob. And this is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the Israelites before his death. He said: The Lord has come from Sinai, and he appeared to us from Seir; he made haste from Mount Paran with ten thousands of Kadesh, at his right, his angels with him. And he had pity on his people, and all the holy ones were under your hands; even these were under you; and it [the people] received his words, the law which Moses commanded us, an inheritance for the assemblies of Jacob. The fundamental difference is that the Septuagint version has angels at Sinai (v. 2) and the traditional text doesn't. In verse 3 the traditional Hebrew text seems to suggest that "the holy ones" are the Israelites who will receive the law. The Septuagint has angels at God's right hand-the position of authority-witnessing the giving of the law to Israel.

> The concept of otherness was at the core of Israelite identity. Otherness is the core of holiness. The Hebrew vocabulary for holiness means to be set apart or to be distinct. While the idea has a moral dimension related to conduct, it is not intrinsically about morality. It is about distinction. Israel's identification with Yahweh by virtue of his covenant with Abraham and the terms of the covenant at Sinai meant that, as Leviticus 19:2 concisely summarizes, Israelites were to be set apart ("holy") as Yahweh was set apart ("holy").1

> The theological messaging couldn't be more dramatic. Jesus says he will build his church-and the "gates of hell" will not prevail against it. We often think of this phrase as though God's people are in a posture of having to bravely fend off Satan and his demons. This simply isn't correct. Gates are defensive structures, not offensive weapons. The kingdom of God is the aggressor.16 Jesus begins at ground zero in the cosmic geography of both testaments to announce the great reversal. It is the gates of hell that are under assault-and they will not hold up against the Church. Hell will one day be Satan's tomb.

> We are the place where God dwells-the same presence that filled the temple in the Old Testament. The same concept is less obvious in other passages. For example, while most Christians will have heard of the tabernacle, most never discern that Paul transfers the language of the tabernacle to the believer to make the specific point that the same presence that oriented holy ground in Israel's camp indwells the believer. In 2 Corinthians the apostle writes: 1 For we know that if our earthly house, the tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens. 2 For indeed, in this house we groan, because we desire to put on our dwelling from heaven (2 Cor 5:1-2). Paul compares the believer's body-which he had called God's temple in his first letter to the Corinthians (1 Cor 6:19)-to a tent. The Greek word translated "tent" is skenos, a term closely related to skene, the term used in 2 Corinthians 5:1-4 of Israel's tabernacle, and which is used in the Septuagint for the tabernacle (e.g., Exod 29:4). The implications are startling. We have all likely heard the verse where Jesus says, "Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there in the midst of them" (Matt 18:20). But put in the context of this other New Testament language, which in turn is informed by the Old Testament imagery of the tabernacle and temple, it means that wherever believers are and gather, the spiritual ground they occupy is sanctified amid the powers of darkness. If we could see with spiritual eyes, we would see a world of darkness peppered with the lights of Yahweh's presence, spreading out to meet each other, inexorably pressing and spreading out to take back the ground of the disinherited nations from the enemy. Of course we would also see those lights surrounded by darkness. The imagery requires perspective. At one time, not long ago, there was one light, meandering its way through the domains of hostile gods. That light nearly went out, scattered to all parts of the known world in tiny embers. But then another solitary, but great, light shone in darkness (Isa 60:1; Matt 4:16). That light would turn the darkness into light (Isa 42:16), and the nations would be drawn to it (Isa 60:1-3). The New Testament portrayal of the spiritual war doesn't hide the task from the reader. The people of God, in whom is the Name, the presence of Yahweh, are surrounded, as they have been before. The apostles understood that but were not faint of heart. There would be no surrender of holy ground in the midst of darkness. Some of the things they taught early believers to observe in fact commemorated the unseen conflict raging around them. Everyone had to choose a side.

> Within the Church, there were at times lapses of loyalty when members of the "household of faith" (Gal 6:10) transgressed the moral and doctrinal boundaries set by Yahweh. In such cases, Paul directed believers to remove fellow family members who were unrepentant from the church (1 Cor 5:9-13). More specifically, Paul demanded that the disloyal be "[handed] over ... to Satan" (1 Cor 5:5). Paul further noted the goal of such a decision is "for the destruction of the flesh, in order that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord." What did Paul mean by these phrases? With respect to the "destruction of the flesh," Paul often used the word "flesh" (sarkos) to refer to the physical body, but he sometimes used it to refer to the self-deception of trusting in our own works to merit God's favor, or an ungodly manner of life.13 Since there is no indication that someone expelled from the church was going to die immediately as a result, this second usage makes the most sense in 1 Corinthians 5. Paul is insisting that the unrepentant person be dismissed from the church to live in his or her sin and endure the consequences of the behavior. Since salvation was not based in any way on human merit, the erring believer would be saved in the end, but care must be taken to avoid self-destructive sinful behavior from leading other believers astray. But what about "handed over to Satan"? Recall that the Israelites viewed their land as holy ground and the territory of the non-Israelite nations as controlled by demonic gods. Israel was holy ground because that was where the presence of Yahweh resided. The opposite was true everywhere else. In the last chapter, we saw that gatherings of believers were viewed the same way. God's presence was no longer in the Jerusalem temple, but in the temple which is the body of Christ (1 Cor 3:16-17). The Corinthian church was therefore "holy ground"; outside that gathering was the demonic realm. To be expelled from the church was to be thrust into the realm of Satan.
