# Overview

Mere Christianity originated from a series of BBC radio talks that C. S. Lewis delivered during World War II, aiming to articulate the core beliefs shared by all Christian denominations. The work is organised into four books, each addressing a distinct aspect of the Christian faith.

Book 1, titled “Right and wrong as a clue to the meaning of the universe,” argues that a universal Moral Law is inherent to human nature. Lewis contends that this law cannot be reduced to social convention or mere instinct but points to a real, timeless standard imposed by a mind beyond the material world.

Book 2, “What Christians believe,” examines various conceptions of God, contrasts Pantheism with a personal Creator, and addresses the problem of evil. Lewis explains that God’s gift of free will makes moral choice possible, introduces Jesus Christ as the necessary means of atonement, and asserts that one must accept Christ as Lord, liar or lunatic.

Book 3, “Christian behaviour,” explores what living a Christian life entails. It defines morality in three parts - harmony with oneself, others and God - and surveys the cardinal virtues, sexual morality, marriage, forgiveness, the perils of pride, and the three theological virtues of faith, hope and charity.

Book 4, “Beyond personality: or first steps in the doctrine of the Trinity,” delves into the relations within the Godhead, considers God’s interaction with time, and likens spiritual growth to a “good infection” spread by Christ. It explores how understanding the Trinity transforms Christian character and community life.
