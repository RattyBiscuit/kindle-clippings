> What about the meaning of touching the foreskin to the "feet"? This is not part of the normal circumcision ritual. However, the Hebrew word translated "feet" (rgl, regel) is also used as a euphemism for genitalia or genital functions, including sexual exposure (see Judg 3:24; 1 Sam 24:3; Ezek 16:25; Ruth 3:4, 7). The phrase in Exodus 4:25 makes sense only if Zipporah circumcised her son, Gershom, and then symbolically transferred that circumcision to Moses by taking the foreskin and touching Moses' genitals. Performing this rite was not only prudent, but courageous. Circumcision in Israel was performed only by religious duty-and only by men. Moses had neglected the ritual, and now he, Zipporah, and little Gershom were already on the road back to Egypt. A circumcised Moses would be unable to travel, so Zipporah performed the ritual on Gershom and, symbolically, on Moses. Her deed was unprecedented, but necessary. Zipporah acted in faith, and God relented. She saved Moses' life and also atoned for his negligence. Moses was now a proper "bridegroom of blood."

> Deuteronomy 32:8 is a textbook example of how later scribes sometimes changed the biblical text in a misguided attempt to "protect" God's reputation.

> In the literature of ancient Ugarit, the god Baal battles Yamm, who is portrayed as a chaotic, churning sea and a terrifying sea dragon named Tannun or Litanu. These terms are equivalent to the Hebrew words in Psalm 74:13-14: "You divided the sea (ym, yam) by your might; you broke the heads of the sea monsters (tnynym, tanninim) on the waters. You crushed the heads of Leviathan (lvytn, liwyatan)." Other parallels are found elsewhere in the Old Testament. In Ugaritic stories, Litanu is described as a "twisting serpent" and a "fleeing serpent." Those precise phrases are used to describe the sea beast Leviathan in the Old Testament (Isa 27:1; Job 26:13).

> This example shows that it's worth our time to check cross references, especially in quotations. Do it yourself by comparing New Testament quotations both to translations of the traditional Hebrew text, like the NASB or ESV, and an up-to-date English translation of the Septuagint.1

> In Numbers 21 God makes use of this familiar cultural idea to communicate an offer of divine deliverance to the Israelites. Also Symbolism God's use of serpent symbolism for healing was appropriate for other reasons. Israelites, like other Semitic peoples, associated serpents with life and healing. Snakes were thought to have regenerative healing powers because they shed their skin. Serpent images were a common motif in ancient Near Eastern art. Storage jars often included serpent imagery-perhaps to ward off theft or spoilage. The Greek god of healing, Asclepius, was depicted as a snake. The rod of Asclepius, a staff entwined by a snake, is still a symbol for medicine and healing today. Here, Yahweh uses this imagery to proclaim His sovereignty over other gods.

> We're most familiar with prophecies directly from the mouth of a prophet. But a "type" is an unspoken prophecy; it is an event, person, or institution that foreshadows something that will come. For example, Paul tells us that Adam was a type of Christ. He foreshadowed or echoed something about Jesus, namely that His work on the cross would affect all people just as Adam's disobedience had a global effect (Rom 5:14).
