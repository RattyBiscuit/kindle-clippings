I Dare You Not to Bore Me with the Bible is a vibrant collection of essays that tackles the Bible’s most perplexing and often overlooked passages, bringing fresh insight through ancient context and scholarly clarity. Michael S. Heiser curates contributions originally published in Bible Study Magazine, each aimed at transforming “weird” or “boring” texts into riveting gateways for understanding Scripture’s depth and nuance.

Drawing on his expertise in ancient Semitic languages and the supernatural worldview of the biblical writers, Heiser invites readers to explore topics ranging from Israelite cosmology and textual transmission to obscure rituals and theological controversies. By unpacking these oddities, the book equips believers to appreciate the Bible in its entirety and to approach every passage - no matter how strange - without dread or dismissal.
