> I think it's this: for most of us, prayer doesn't resolve our anxiety. Scripture teaches, "Don't be anxious. Just pray." Maybe we don't because prayer comes with plenty of reasons to be anxious. Prayer itself makes us anxious because it uncovers fears we can ignore as long as we don't engage deeply, thoughtfully, vulnerably with God.

> Prayer can't be mastered. Prayer always means submission. To pray is to willingly put ourselves in the unguarded, exposed position. There is no climb. There is no control. There is no mastery. There is only humility and hope.

> What if I actually strip away the music and the community and the sermon, strip away all the noise of my familiar faith expression? Left with just me and God, what if I discover there's actually not much to just me and God? Prayer means the risk of facing silence where we're addicted to noise. It's the risk of facing a God we've mastered talking about, singing about, reading about, and learning about. It means risking real interaction with that God, and the longer we've gotten used to settling for the noise around God, the higher the stakes. What if it's awkward or disappointing or boring, or what if God stands me up altogether?

> Jesus once wisely said that we'll know a tree by its fruit.6 So what's the fruit of that story of self-sufficiency in the life of the modern person? We're overwhelmed. Everyone I meet is drowning in "their thing." It doesn't matter if "your thing" is an artistic endeavor, profit margins, wining and dining clients, or raising children. We can't see past "our thing" because "our thing" (whatever it happens to be) is all-consuming.

*Page 18 (Location 334-336)*

> Constantly overwhelmed lives should drive us to prayer at its purest and rawest, but the tendency for many of us is to pray safe, calculated prayers that insulate us from both disappointment and freedom.

> Pray as you can, and somewhere along the way, you will make the most important discovery of your life-the love the Father has for you. That discovery is God's end of the deal. Your part is just to show up honestly. Show up, and keep showing up. That's the one nonnegotiable when it comes to prayer.

> Ted Loder: Holy One, there is something I wanted to tell you, but there have been errands to run, bills to pay, arrangements to make, meetings to attend, friends to entertain, washing to do ... and I forget what it is I wanted to say to you, and mostly I forget what I'm about or why. O God, don't forget me, please, for the sake of Jesus Christ. Eternal One, there is something I wanted to tell you, but my mind races with worrying and watching, with weighing and planning, with rutted slights and pothole grievances, with leaky dreams and leaky plumbing and leaky relationships I keep trying to plug up; and my attention is preoccupied with loneliness, with doubt, and with things I covet; and I forget what it is I want to say to you, and how to say it honestly or how to do much of anything. O God, don't forget me, please, for the sake of Jesus Christ. Almighty One, there is something I wanted to ask you, but I stumble along the edge of a nameless rage, haunted by a hundred floating fears of terrorists of all kinds, of losing my job, of failing, of getting sick and old, having loved ones die, of dying ... I forget what the real question is that I wanted to ask, and I forget to listen anyway because you seem unreal and far away, and I forget what it is I have forgotten. O God, don't forget me, please, for the sake of Jesus Christ ... O Father ... in Heaven, perhaps you've already heard what I wanted to tell you. What I wanted to ask is forgive me, heal me, increase my courage, please. Renew in me a little of love and faith, and a sense of confidence, and a vision of what it might mean to live as though you were real, and I mattered, and everyone was sister and brother. What I wanted to ask in my blundering way is don't give up on me, don't become too sad about me, but laugh with me, and try again with me, and I will with you, too. What I wanted to ask is for peace enough to want and work for more, for joy enough to share, and for awareness that is keen enough to sense your presence here, now, there, then, always.

> Prayer doesn't begin with us; it begins with God. It doesn't start with speaking; it starts with seeing. As Philip Yancey writes, "Prayer is the act of seeing reality from God's point of view."

> Carl Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist whose research is the basis of the Myers-Briggs personality test, put it bluntly: "Hurry is not of the Devil; it is the Devil."12 The modern-day sage Richard Foster writes, "In contemporary society our Adversary [a biblical title for the devil] majors in three things: noise, hurry, and crowds. If he can keep us engaged in 'muchness' and 'manyness,' he will rest satisfied."13 A journalist once asked theologian Thomas Merton to diagnose the leading spiritual disease of our time. Merton gave a one-word answer: "efficiency."

> "Be still." The Latin term is vacate, from which we get the English word vacation. The invitation of prayer anytime, anywhere is this: Take a vacation. Stop playing God over your own life for a moment. Release control. Return to the created order.

*Page 47 (Location 745-747)*

> When I pray, when I see myself as I really am from God's perspective, I behold not only my own smallness but also how valuable I truly am to God. David goes on to pray things like, "God keeps count of my anxious tossing while trying to sleep and bottles up every tear I've ever shed. God's good thoughts toward me outnumber the grains of sand on the world's beaches!"

---

*Page 48 (Location 763-766)*

> Jesus was intentional and interruptible. There's a word for that posture: unhurried. Hurry is the great enemy of the spiritual life. Why? Because hurry kills love. Hurry hides behind anger, agitation, and self-centeredness, blinding our eyes to the truth that we are God's beloved and she is sister, he is brother.

---

*Page 48 (Location 770-773)*

> Stillness before God transforms us into unhurried love. It is in the stillness of silent prayer that God turns over the soil of our hearts, revealing our desires to us and the source of their fullest satisfaction. When we stop moving, stop talking, and arrive present and quiet before God, he takes all of our disordered desires, distorted attachments, and codependencies and transforms them into love.

---

*Page 63 (Location 974-979)*

> "Teach us to pray," the disciples say to Jesus. And he responds, in essence, "Start by remembering who you're talking to." Biblically, we are commanded to "remember" more frequently than to "obey," "do," "not do," "go," or even "pray." Remember. Because in the long journey of the spiritual life, we tend to forget. We tend to lose the plot of our own redemption story. When Jesus teaches us to pray, he picks up on that same thread. "Remember who you're talking to." Remember who God is. Remember who you are. Remember who we are to each other.

> "Where are you, God? We want to see you. You are the loving Father. You promise to be a shelter in chaos, the calm in the raging storm, freedom for the captive! So be who you say you are. Show yourself here." That's the subtext beneath the a cappella hymn session coming from the innermost cell.

> Historically in the Christian tradition, the prayer of examen has provided an effective framework for gratitude. Typically prayed in the evening, examen begins by reviewing the day with God, playing back the events of the day like a movie and thanking God for every good thing along the way-the first sip of coffee that morning, the moment of laughter with your daughter, the insightful conversation with a colleague, the progress made on a big project, and on and on it goes. Next, invite the Holy Spirit to illuminate the day, showing you the moment when God's presence felt nearest and the moment his presence felt most distant. While God is always with us, our awareness of his presence wanes. Finally, pray a simple prayer of intercession for tomorrow.

> The Greek word translated in the NIV as "empathize" is the compound word sympatheo. It is a combination of the Greek word pascho, meaning "to suffer" and the prefix sun ("with"), much like we used the prefix co- in English. This word, translated literally, means "co-suffer." That's how Jesus deals with our sin. He suffers with us-suffers the consequences of our thoughts, actions, and disordered desires; suffers the subtle agony of hiding and pretending and presenting a preferred self that traps us in perpetual insecurity; suffers the estrangement from God we willfully choose by "managing" a sin pattern we've grown tired of confessing rather than bringing it into the light of his inexhaustible love.

---

*Page 80 (Location 1195-1201)*

> Here is the source of his empathy: "[Jesus] has been tempted in every way, just as we are-yet he did not sin."17 Jesus is a healer, yes, but he's the kind of doctor who has dealt with the same disease. He's a doctor treating lung cancer who also had lung cancer, felt the effects, and even donated one of his lungs for a transplant, so you're talking to a doctor with experiential compassion for what you're going through and a wounded body from a battle with the same symptoms. Don't you see the profound difference in that healer? The care, sincere concern, and unhurried presence of that doctor compared to the one who just dishes out prescriptions?

---

*Page 81 (Location 1210-1211)*

> How do we take Jesus up on his power to heal? Confession. Confession is how we turn to him, look him in the eye, and acknowledge his presence here with us, not to judge, but to rescue.

> Eugene Peterson writes, "God does not deal with sin by ridding our lives of it as if it were a germ, or mice in the attic. God does not deal with sin by amputation as if it were a gangrenous leg, leaving us crippled, holiness on a crutch. God deals with sin by forgiving us, and when he forgives us there is more of us, not less."

*Page 96 (Location 1399-1401)*

> "History belongs to the intercessors"-what a compelling wonder! That is, until we actually begin to pray, and all that confidence and inspiration are drowned in a tsunami of questions, doubts, confusion, and past disappointment.

---

*Page 107 (Location 1563-1566)*

> Here's the best part of the whole story, the bit that really blows my mind. God doesn't need intercessors managing his creation. He's not overwhelmed by all the responsibility of overseeing the world. He's all-knowing, all-powerful, and completely outside of time. He's got this. God doesn't need intercessors; God chooses intercessors.

> Every great move of God in church history, every revival and awakening, follows a common pattern: the church catches fire, leading to an increased priority of prayer, resulting in an outpouring of the Spirit on a city. In the words of J. Edwin Orr, "Whenever God is ready to do something new with His people, He always sets them to praying."

---

*Page 195 (Location 2780-2782)*

> The overwhelming historic evidence is that Jesus prayed according to the temple rhythm-three times a day-observing the same morning, midday, and evening rhythm we see in Daniel and the Psalms. In fact, many of the biblical references to Jesus in prayer fall into that category.

---

*Page 198 (Location 2828-2830)*

> A daily prayer rhythm is about fidelity. It has absolutely everything to do with love and absolutely nothing to do with legalism. Jesus' personal discipline was always about freedom and life. When he rolled out of bed and made his way alone to the Mount of Olives to pray, it was love that drove him there, not a spiritual scorecard.

---

*Page 199 (Location 2834-2838)*

> Commitments, not feelings, are how we show our love. David Brooks defines a commitment as "falling in love with something [or someone] and then building a structure of behavior around it for those moments when love falters."25 Jesus was getting at the same thing when he invited us to take on his "easy yoke."26 And that's all a daily prayer rhythm is-a structure to support our deepest desires, even when our feelings and emotions betray us.

*Page 206 (Location 2956-2968)*

> During the Jewish Passover, the Israelites traditionally sang a gratitude song called dayenu. Dayenu means "it would have been enough."40 I once heard a pastor offer this translation: "Thank you, God, for overdoing it." Dayenu prayers sound like, "God, lunch today would've been enough, but you provided me with the resources to choose the type of food I wanted to eat and options to pick from." "God, lunch of my choice would've been enough, but you created a world of flavor and spice and culture to make food more than fuel-to offer it as artistic and delicious." "God, a delicious lunch of my choice would've been enough, but you gave me a coworker to share a conversation with over that food." "Thank you, God, for overdoing it." That's dayenu. And in thirty seconds or thirty minutes, that's how we pray gratitude. This is such a small, manageable shift that will bear extraordinary fruit. What if you began to litter your dinner table with the fruit of the Spirit instead of the day's leftovers?

> "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"6 That's a prayer I can get behind, one I can identify with. "Where are you, God?" I've whispered that prayer under my breath, my own voice quivering, more times than I can count. These words weren't original to Jesus. He's borrowing from the Psalms, the original hymnal, to pray the words of David that open Psalm 22. Scripture is careful to note, though, that Jesus didn't pray it in the polished, refined Hebrew it was first written in. Jesus prayed it in Aramaic, the common language of the pubs and schoolyards: "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" According to New Testament scholar Richard Bauckham, by praying this in the Aramaic, Jesus was personalizing the psalm.7 He wasn't just noting that he seemed to be experiencing something of what David had described all those years before; he was crying across history-past, present, and future-his voice echoing from beginning to end, "Where are you, God?" What David prayed in Psalm 22, what I've prayed so many times before and am bound to pray again, was concentrated and fulfilled in Jesus.

*Page 229 (Location 3239-3243)*

> Novelist and pastor Frederick Buechner summarizes: "For what we need to know, of course, is not just that God exists, not just that beyond the steely brightness of the stars there is a cosmic intelligence of some kind that keeps the whole show going, but that there is a God right here in the thick of our day-by-day lives ... It is not objective proof of God's existence that we want but the experience of God's presence. That is the miracle that we are really after, and that is also, I think, the miracle that we really get."18

*Page 230 (Location 3263-3271)*

> As noted earlier, the heartbreaking prayer of Jesus from the cross-"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"-was the first line of Psalm 22. Jesus recited a Davidic psalm in front of a majority Jewish crowd. Everyone in the crowd would've recited this prayer from childhood. They knew it by heart. Jesus prayed the first line, and that was all he needed to do. Every face in the crowd knew where it ended. Psalm 22 opened with the expression of debilitating isolation and emotional turmoil. That's where it started, but that wasn't where it ended. For he has not despised or scorned the suffering of the afflicted one; he has not hidden his face from him but has listened to his cry for help. From you comes the theme of my praise in the great assembly; before those who fear you I will fulfill my vows. (Psalm 22:24-25) It ended not in despair but in exultation, not in isolation but community. When Jesus prayed Psalm 22 from the cross, he was praying in place of all of us.

*Page 231 (Location 3274-3276)*

> One of my most frequent prayers is to simply try to get in touch with his prayers for me. I usually phrase it as a question: "Jesus if you were to walk in the room right now, what would you want to say to me?" Ask him. Be still and wait. In my experience, he's eager to share his heart.
