> What I've heard in church over the years doesn't just miss the boat-it makes the supernatural boring. And even worse, the church's teaching emasculates the unseen, supernatural world, rendering it powerless. A lot of what Christians imagine to be true about the unseen world isn't. Angels don't have wings. (Cherubim don't count because they are never called angels and are creaturely. Angels are always in human form.) Demons don't sport horns and a tail, and they aren't here to make us sin (we do that just fine on our own). And while the Bible describes demonic possession in rightfully awful ways, intelligent evil has more sinister things to do than make sock puppets out of people. And on top of that, angels and demons are minor players. Church never seems to get to the big boys and their agenda.

> In Daniel 4, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was punished by God with temporary insanity. That sentence was handed down by "the decree of the Most High" (Dan. 4:24) and "the decree of the watchers" (Dan. 4:17). Watchers was a term used for divine beings of God's council. It referred to how they were ever watchful over the affairs of humanity; they never slept.

> What we've learned has an impact on so much of how we see each other and relate to each other. Racism has no place in God's world. Injustice is incompatible with representing God. The abuse of power-at home, at work, or in government-is ungodly. It is not how God dealt with his children in Eden, so it has no place in how we deal with fellow imagers.

---

*Page 28 (Location 339-341)*

> Every legitimate task can be part of moving our world toward Eden and blessing fellow imagers-or not. God doesn't view people in ministry as more holy or special because of their job descriptions. God cares about how each of us represents him where we are. We either stand against the darkness, sharing the life God wants everyone to ultimately experience, or we don't.

> When David heard about Saul's plan, he asked God: "Will the leaders of Keilah betray me to him? And will Saul actually come as I have heard? O LORD, God of Israel, please tell me." And the LORD said, "He will come ... Yes, they will betray you." (1 Sam. 23:11-12 NLT) David then did what any of us would do-he got out of the city as fast as he could. And that tells us why God's foreknowledge of events doesn't mean they are predestined. 1 Samuel 23 has God foreknowing two events that never actually took place. That God foreknew there would be divine rebellion and human failure doesn't mean he made those things happen. Foreknowledge doesn't require predestination.

---

*Page 37 (Location 458-460)*

> He also knew we would be born sinners and fail (a lot-let's be honest). But he didn't predestine those failures. When we sin, we need to own our sin. We sin because we choose to. We can't say God willed it, or that we had no choice because it was predestined.

*Page 37 (Location 466-469)*

> We might ask why God doesn't just eliminate evil right now. There's a reason: For God to eliminate evil he'd have to eliminate his imagers, human and divine, who are not perfect like he is. That would solve the problem of evil, but it would mean that God's original idea, to create other divine agents and human beings to live and rule with him, was a huge mistake. God doesn't make mistakes.

> Unbelievers are essentially hostages of spiritual forces. They need the gospel to be set free. And don't forget: It is the gospel that is our weapon. We aren't authorized to confront principalities and powers directly. There's no spiritual gift to that effect handed down to us by the apostles. But the faithful dispensing of the gospel will turn the tide. The Great Commission is a spiritual battle plan.

*Page 45 (Location 584-587)*

> We need to view every congregation of true believers as holy ground. External appearances, buildings, and the size of the congregation are of no concern to God. What matters is that, where two or three are gathered, Jesus is in their midst (Matt. 18:20). The space is sacred. Every congregation, no matter how small or unknown, is on the front lines of a spiritual war. Every church has the same task.

> God wanted a human family. He wanted to live on his creation, earth, with the people he had made. He wanted his unseen family and his human family to live with him and serve him. He wanted people to multiply and for all the earth to become like Eden.

> What did holiness mean? What was the concept behind it? Holiness did not mean being odd. Holiness was to be identified with the Lord, to be dedicated to God and to enjoy all the good things in life that come with being right with God.

> Whether in the Old Testament or the New, salvation is never earned, or even deserved. It's given by the grace of God in response to faith. Israelites too, just like those of us born after Christ's death and resurrection, had to have faith. They had to believe their God was the God of all gods, trusting that he had made them his people. They alone had access to the God of gods. The Law was not how Israelites achieved salvation-it was how they showed loyalty to the God they believed in.

*Page 82 (Location 1088-1091)*

> As Paul said, had they and Satan understood that, they would never have moved people like Judas to betray Jesus to those who wanted him dead. The Devil and those aligned with him are lots of things, but they aren't morons. They were duped into killing Jesus, just as God had planned. They launched the series of events that would lead to their own demise. It was divinely designed misdirection.

*Page 83 (Location 1111-1114)*

> Intelligent evil-Satan, demons, the lesser gods who rule the nations-do not know everything. They do not have the mind of God, nor can they penetrate it. We tend to presume that because they are supernatural they are all-knowing. Not true. There is only one omniscient being-God. And he happens to be on our side.

*Page 93 (Location 1242-1246)*

> Our task is to imitate Jesus. We can, like him, care for both body and soul of our fellow imagers, leading them to faith in the King and strengthening their resolve to be loyal to him. It doesn't necessarily take supernatural power to "bind up the brokenhearted" and "proclaim liberty to the captives" in the steps of the messiah (Isa. 61:1), but these are supernatural acts at the core. They demand resistance to darkness and strategic vision. No act of kindness will fail to be used by the Spirit to direct someone's heart. No articulation of the gospel will be fruitless.

> We are "already but not yet" co-rulers with him (Col. 3:1; 2 Tim. 2:12; Rev. 2:26; 3:21). The gates of hell will not withstand the progression and completion of the Church as God's kingdom on earth. The decision to participate in the great reversal is ours.

> Because everywhere else that description occurs in the Old Testament, it was used only of God himself (Isa. 19:1; Deut. 33:26; Ps. 68:32-33; Ps. 104:1-4). But in Daniel 7, God was already in the scene as the Ancient of Days. It's as if, in his vision, Daniel sees a "second God" who is also a man-something like the way Christians believe in God as more than one person.

> Satan was expelled from God's presence when the kingdom began on earth (Luke 10:18). God would have no more of his accusations against believers. He had no more right to our souls. Why, then, do we live as though he does? Salvation is not gained by moral perfection. It is a gift that comes by grace, through faith (Eph. 2:8-9). That in turn means salvation cannot be lost by moral imperfection. What is not at all gained by performance cannot be lost by poor performance. Salvation is about believing loyalty-trusting what Jesus did to defeat Satan's claim and turning from all other gods and the belief systems of which they are a part.

> If we are instruments of God in the same way Paul was an instrument of God, then why was he so much more influential and effective? One difference is that Paul understood what his life was about. He believed the powers that had dominion over the earth were real-and that the power behind and within him was greater.

> What if, each day, our lives were organized around our knowledge of our status as part of God's family, tasked with delivering siblings from darkness? What if we lived intentionally, knowing that each decision we make and each word we speak isn't randomly purposeless? What if, instead, we believed unseen intelligences all around us use our decisions, our actions, our words to influence other people-for good or evil-whether or not we see or know them?

> That's what Peter is getting at in 1 Peter 3. In essence, baptism was a loyalty oath and a message to the demonic powers (as well as any people present) of just whose side you were on in the spiritual war. Ancient Christians understood this better than we do today. Early church baptismal rites included a renunciation of Satan and his angels because of this passage.

---

*Page 117 (Location 1588-1592)*

> A third implication of what we've discussed in this chapter is that the powers of darkness know whose side we are on by our behavior. They are not stupid. They see our loyalty to God, and they see us act on our decisions to follow Jesus through things like baptism and resistance to sin. But they also see us when we act disloyally to God, and they understand what vulnerability that introduces into our lives. Whether or not we believe it, we are being watched-by both sides of the spiritual war.

> Israelites referred to the people of the disinherited nations by many terms. There were geographical or ethnic labels (e.g., Egyptians, Moabites, Amalekites), but the comprehensive description in New Testament times was Gentile, a label that comes from the Latin word for "nations" (gens). If you aren't Jewish, you're a Gentile.
