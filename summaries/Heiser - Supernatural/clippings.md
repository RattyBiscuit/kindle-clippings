> What I've heard in church over the years doesn't just miss the boat-it makes the supernatural boring. And even worse, the church's teaching emasculates the unseen, supernatural world, rendering it powerless. A lot of what Christians imagine to be true about the unseen world isn't. Angels don't have wings. (Cherubim don't count because they are never called angels and are creaturely. Angels are always in human form.) Demons don't sport horns and a tail, and they aren't here to make us sin (we do that just fine on our own). And while the Bible describes demonic possession in rightfully awful ways, intelligent evil has more sinister things to do than make sock puppets out of people. And on top of that, angels and demons are minor players. Church never seems to get to the big boys and their agenda.

> In Daniel 4, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was punished by God with temporary insanity. That sentence was handed down by "the decree of the Most High" (Dan. 4:24) and "the decree of the watchers" (Dan. 4:17). Watchers was a term used for divine beings of God's council. It referred to how they were ever watchful over the affairs of humanity; they never slept.

> What we've learned has an impact on so much of how we see each other and relate to each other. Racism has no place in God's world. Injustice is incompatible with representing God. The abuse of power-at home, at work, or in government-is ungodly. It is not how God dealt with his children in Eden, so it has no place in how we deal with fellow imagers.

> Every legitimate task can be part of moving our world toward Eden and blessing fellow imagers-or not. God doesn't view people in ministry as more holy or special because of their job descriptions. God cares about how each of us represents him where we are. We either stand against the darkness, sharing the life God wants everyone to ultimately experience, or we don't.

> When David heard about Saul's plan, he asked God: "Will the leaders of Keilah betray me to him? And will Saul actually come as I have heard? O LORD, God of Israel, please tell me." And the LORD said, "He will come ... Yes, they will betray you." (1 Sam. 23:11-12 NLT) David then did what any of us would do-he got out of the city as fast as he could. And that tells us why God's foreknowledge of events doesn't mean they are predestined. 1 Samuel 23 has God foreknowing two events that never actually took place. That God foreknew there would be divine rebellion and human failure doesn't mean he made those things happen. Foreknowledge doesn't require predestination.

> He also knew we would be born sinners and fail (a lot-let's be honest). But he didn't predestine those failures. When we sin, we need to own our sin. We sin because we choose to. We can't say God willed it, or that we had no choice because it was predestined.

> We might ask why God doesn't just eliminate evil right now. There's a reason: For God to eliminate evil he'd have to eliminate his imagers, human and divine, who are not perfect like he is. That would solve the problem of evil, but it would mean that God's original idea, to create other divine agents and human beings to live and rule with him, was a huge mistake. God doesn't make mistakes.

> Unbelievers are essentially hostages of spiritual forces. They need the gospel to be set free. And don't forget: It is the gospel that is our weapon. We aren't authorized to confront principalities and powers directly. There's no spiritual gift to that effect handed down to us by the apostles. But the faithful dispensing of the gospel will turn the tide. The Great Commission is a spiritual battle plan.

> We need to view every congregation of true believers as holy ground. External appearances, buildings, and the size of the congregation are of no concern to God. What matters is that, where two or three are gathered, Jesus is in their midst (Matt. 18:20). The space is sacred. Every congregation, no matter how small or unknown, is on the front lines of a spiritual war. Every church has the same task.

> God wanted a human family. He wanted to live on his creation, earth, with the people he had made. He wanted his unseen family and his human family to live with him and serve him. He wanted people to multiply and for all the earth to become like Eden.

> What did holiness mean? What was the concept behind it? Holiness did not mean being odd. Holiness was to be identified with the Lord, to be dedicated to God and to enjoy all the good things in life that come with being right with God.

> Whether in the Old Testament or the New, salvation is never earned, or even deserved. It's given by the grace of God in response to faith. Israelites too, just like those of us born after Christ's death and resurrection, had to have faith. They had to believe their God was the God of all gods, trusting that he had made them his people. They alone had access to the God of gods. The Law was not how Israelites achieved salvation-it was how they showed loyalty to the God they believed in.

> As Paul said, had they and Satan understood that, they would never have moved people like Judas to betray Jesus to those who wanted him dead. The Devil and those aligned with him are lots of things, but they aren't morons. They were duped into killing Jesus, just as God had planned. They launched the series of events that would lead to their own demise. It was divinely designed misdirection.

> Intelligent evil-Satan, demons, the lesser gods who rule the nations-do not know everything. They do not have the mind of God, nor can they penetrate it. We tend to presume that because they are supernatural they are all-knowing. Not true. There is only one omniscient being-God. And he happens to be on our side.
