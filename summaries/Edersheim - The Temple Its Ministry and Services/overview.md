Alfred Edersheim's "The Temple: Its Ministry and Service" serves as a detailed exploration of the Jerusalem Temple during the time of Jesus Christ. Aimed at both scholars and general readers, the book provides a vivid description of the Temple's architecture, rituals, and the religious life of the Jewish people. Edersheim uses a rich array of sources—including Scripture, rabbinical texts, and works from historians like Josephus and Philo—to construct a comprehensive look at the Temple’s functions, its priesthood, and its significance in Jewish worship.

The central thesis of Edersheim’s work is that understanding the Temple and its practices is essential for grasping the background of the New Testament and the life of Jesus. Edersheim invites readers back to the first century, portraying a vibrant daily life filled with religious ceremonies and communal worship that shaped the identity of the Jewish nation.
