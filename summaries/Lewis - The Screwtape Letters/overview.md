The Screwtape Letters is a satirical Christian apologetic novel by C. S. Lewis, first published in 1942, written as 31 letters from a senior devil, Screwtape, to his nephew Wormwood, a novice tempter. Through their correspondence, Lewis explores the subtleties of temptation, the corrupting influence of pride and materialism, and the discipline required for spiritual vigilance.
