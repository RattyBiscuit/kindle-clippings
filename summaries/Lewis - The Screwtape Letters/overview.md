"The Screwtape Letters" is a satirical and philosophical work by C.S. Lewis, presented in the form of letters from a senior demon, Screwtape, to his nephew, Wormwood. The book articulates the nature of temptation, sin, and the spiritual struggles faced by humans. Through these fictional correspondence, Lewis explores how demons might influence human behaviour and the strategies they employ to lead individuals away from faith and righteousness.

The central premise revolves around a young man referred to as "the patient." As the story progresses, Screwtape provides Wormwood with advice on how to exploit the patient’s weaknesses, turning everyday experiences into opportunities for temptation. The letters reveal insights into not only the tactics of evil but also the nature of good, faith, and divine grace. Ultimately, Lewis crafts a compelling narrative that encourages readers to reflect on their own spiritual journeys and the invisible forces that influence them.
