### Preface

Lewis claims to have discovered Screwtape’s letters but refuses to explain their provenance, warning readers that they present a devil’s perspective and should not be taken at face value.

### Letter 1: The Enemy’s Plan

Screwtape introduces Wormwood to the complexities of human nature and the importance of keeping the patient away from Christianity. He advises him to focus on the patient’s mundane life.

### Letter 2: The Value of the Patient's Distraction

Screwtape advises Wormwood to make the patient preoccupied with trivialities and to encourage him to prioritise the “ordinary” over spiritual matters, distracting him from serious contemplation.

### Letter 3: The Power of Choice

In this letter, Screwtape discusses the significance of free will and suggests that Wormwood promote the idea of relativism, helping the patient to rationalise sin under the guise of personal choice.

### Letter 4: The Influence of Friendship

Screwtape emphasises the power of friendships and advises Wormwood to use the patient's social circle to create doubt and weaken his faith through negative influences.

### Letter 5: The Value of Temptation

Screwtape discusses the effectiveness of temptation in shaping human behaviours and advises Wormwood to focus on exploiting the patient’s fears and desires.

### Letter 6: The Safety of Pride

This letter discusses pride as a tool. Screwtape advises Wormwood to foster a sense of superiority in the patient, believing himself wiser than those around him, thus isolating him from genuine relationships.

### Letter 7: The Importance of Spiritual Routine

Here, Screwtape cautions Wormwood against the routines of prayer and church attendance, encouraging distractions during these spiritual activities to undermine their effectiveness.

### Letter 8: Exploiting Mortality

Screwtape discusses the awareness of death and advises Wormwood to distract the patient from serious reflections on mortality, promoting instead a shallow, hedonistic approach to life.

### Letter 9: The Dangers of Romantics

This letter addresses love and romance, suggesting that Wormwood should use romantic attachments to lead the patient away from genuine commitment, creating confusion around true love and lust.

### Letter 10: The Enemy in Suffering

Screwtape explains how suffering can lead individuals closer to God, advising Wormwood to keep the patient focused on his own troubles instead of fostering a spirit of humility in the face of adversity.

### Letter 11: The Devil's Advocate

In this letter, Screwtape elaborates on how humans rationalise their actions and the effectiveness of creating a false narrative that convinces the patient his sin is justifiable.

### Letter 12: The Strength of Faith

Screwtape now sees the patient growing spiritually. He warns Wormwood to diminish the patient’s faith by planting seeds of doubt, encouraging him to question beliefs and take them for granted.

### Letter 13: The Power of Love

Screwtape acknowledges that love can counteract their influences. He advises Wormwood to focus on selfishness and superficial desires, steering the patient away from true selflessness.

### Letter 14: The Final Temptation

In the final letters, Screwtape reflects on the patient’s faithfulness and the potent nature of God’s grace. He advises Wormwood that despair is a powerful tool but remains cautious of the patient’s growing resolve.

### Letter 15: The Patient's Salvation

The final letter reveals that the patient has died and embraced faith. Screwtape expresses frustration and warns Wormwood of the importance of vigilance, noting that the defeat of their plans ultimately lies in the hands of the “Enemy,” God.
