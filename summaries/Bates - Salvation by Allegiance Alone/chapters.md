### Chapter 1: Faith is Not

Bates begins by dissecting common misconceptions about faith, arguing against the notion that it is merely intellectual assent. He clarifies that faith must involve loyalty and commitment, rather than simplistic beliefs.

### Chapter 2: Loyalty and the Full Gospel

This chapter emphasises that the gospel must include the kingship of Jesus. Bates argues that proclaiming the gospel involves calling people to allegiance, not simply to a set of beliefs.

### Chapter 3: Jesus Proclaims the Gospel

Bates explores how Jesus' own proclamations emphasised allegiance and fidelity to Him. He contends that understanding Jesus' message requires recognising His role as the cosmic King.

### Chapter 4: Faith as Allegiance

Here, Bates introduces the core thesis that pistis is best understood as "allegiance." He supports this claim with evidence from biblical texts and Second Temple Jewish literature, arguing that allegiance captures the active, committed response required of believers.

### Chapter 5: Questions about Allegiance Alone

In addressing potential objections, Bates reconciles his allegiance-based perspective with traditional views on grace and free will. He insists that while salvation is graciously given, it requires corresponding action.

### Chapter 6: Resurrection into New Creation

Bates shifts focus to the transformative aspect of salvation, discussing the resurrection and the new creation. He emphasizes that salvation is not about escaping to heaven but participating in a renewed universe under Christ.

### Chapter 7: Restoring the Idol of God

This chapter explores the implications of allegiance on worship and how failure to acknowledge Christ’s kingship can lead to idolatry, distracting believers from authentic faith.

### Chapter 8: Justification and Allegiance Alone

Bates reimagines justification not as a standalone event, but as integrally linked to one’s allegiance to Christ. He critiques traditional understandings, arguing for a theological framework that encompasses communal and individual aspects of righteousness.

### Chapter 9: Practicing Allegiance

In the final chapter, Bates discusses practical applications of his thesis for evangelism and discipleship. He highlights the need for a holistic approach where allegiance to Jesus shapes all areas of life, urging readers to consider what truly it means to follow Christ.

---

Bates’ work is both a scholarly examination and a pastoral call to re-evaluate how believers conceptualise faith and salvation. By prioritising allegiance over mere belief, he encourages a vivacious, lived-out faith that transforms individuals and communities. This book poses a significant challenge to traditional doctrines while aiming for greater unity among disparate Christian traditions.
