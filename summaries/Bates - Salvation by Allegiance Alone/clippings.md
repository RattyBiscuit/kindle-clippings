> The superficiality of American evangelicalism's gospel-obsession with security and assurance has led me at times to wonder if we should not teach justification by discipleship. Or justification by faithfulness. But Matthew Bates has landed on a beautiful and biblically sound term: allegiance. When Jesus first called the four disciples along the Sea of Galilee he didn't say "receive me into your heart" but "follow me."

> Moreover, when he finished the greatest sermon on earth, the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus didn't say "Repent and believe these things" but "the one who hears these words of mine and does them." So, too, the apostles Paul, Peter, and John called their listeners to a life swamped by the Spirit, a life of holiness amidst suffering, and a life of living in the light of love. These apostolic expressions are all condensed in this book into the term "allegiance." King Jesus summons people into a kingdom where he alone is king, and kings expect one thing from their subjects: allegiance.

> N. T. Wright offers a different example that helps us reconsider the first-century meaning of "believe" gospel language. Wright notes that the Jewish general Josephus, in his autobiographical recounting of the events of the Jewish-Roman war in AD 66, reports an incident where he urged a rebel leader to "repent and believe in me," using language nearly identical to what we find in the Gospel of Mark with respect to Jesus's proclamation, "The kingdom of God is near! Repent and believe the good news" (1:15).4 Our own cultural experiences might lead us to think that "repent" means to turn away from private sins such as adultery, greed, and exploitation. Meanwhile, in Christian circles "believe" is so often linked to Jesus and the forgiveness of sins that it may be hard to weigh what it means in this example featuring Josephus. But Wright's point is that Josephus was not trying to convince this rebel to turn away from private sins or to "believe" that God can forgive, rather Josephus wanted this man to join him in supporting the Jewish cause-that is, as I would put it, to show allegiance. So, what "repent and believe in me" means for Josephus in this context is "turn away from your present course of action and become loyal to me."

> 1. The true climax of the gospel-Jesus's enthronement-has generally been deemphasized or omitted from the gospel. 2. Consequently, pistis has been misaimed and inappropriately nuanced with respect to the gospel. It is regarded as "trust" in Jesus's righteousness alone or "faith" that Jesus's death covers my sins rather than "allegiance" to Jesus as king. 3. Final salvation is not about attainment of heaven but about embodied participation in the new creation. When the true goal of salvation is recognized, terms such as "faith," "works," "righteousness," and "the gospel" can be more accurately reframed. 4. Once it is agreed that salvation is by allegiance alone, matters that have traditionally divided Catholics and Protestants-the essence of the gospel, faith alone versus works, declared righteousness versus infused righteousness-are reconfigured in ways that may prove helpful for reconciliation.

> We are not to leap out in the dark at a whim, or simply to prove to ourselves, God, or others that we "have faith." But the promise-keeping God might indeed call us to act on invisible realities of his heavenly kingdom. If the call is genuine, we may indeed be bruised by the leap. Yet if it is genuine, in gathering the bruises from the hard landing, we can be certain that we will come to look more like the wounded Son, which is the final goal of redeemed humanity.

> The true thrust of Paul's line of thought is that the resurrection served to trigger the exaltation of Jesus from his lowly status among the dead, so that he came to be installed in a position of sovereign authority. Previously he was the Son of God; now he is the Son-of-God-in-Power, actively reigning until all his enemies are made a footstool for his feet (1 Cor. 15:25). In other words, in his earthly life Jesus was the anointed one, the one chosen as the royal Davidic Messiah (the Christ), but during his earthly sojourn he had not yet received his throne, he had not yet begun to reign as king. But the resurrection (and ascension) changed all this, as Jesus has now been enthroned at the right hand of God and is reigning as the Lord of heaven and earth. In fact, in summing up his presentation of the basic content of the gospel, Paul concludes by calling this Son-of-God-in-Power by slightly different titles that Paul prefers, "Jesus the Christ our Lord" (Rom. 1:4).

> That Jesus died for our sins and, as a portion of that "our," that he also died for my sins is truly part of the gospel-emphatically so!-but it is imperative to realize that it is only a small but vital portion of the gospel as properly understood, not the whole gospel. It is also critical to recognize that "faith" is not primarily aimed at trusting in the forgiveness-of-sins process. For Paul does not primarily call us to "faith" ("belief" or "trust") in some sort of atonement system in order to be saved (although mental affirmation that Jesus died for our sins is necessary), but rather to "faith" ("allegiance") unto Jesus as Lord.

> The world is genuinely different since Jesus defeated his enemies and started to rule actively. The subjective aspect of this good news is that for it to be personally effective, this saving power must be actualized by pistis-which is part of Paul's point in Romans 1:16-17. So the main idea in Romans 1:16-17 is that the gospel is a transformative story because it reveals "the righteousness of God"-that is, the resurrection-effecting verdict that God rendered over Jesus the king and that resulted in our ability to share his resurrection life as a gift from God.

*Page 73 (Location 1006-1011)*

> In brief, my proposal is that we can summarize Paul's interpretation by paraphrasing as follows: For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who gives allegiance to Jesus as the Christ, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed by means of Jesus's allegiance to God; this righteousness becomes ours through our allegiance to Jesus the king. For both Jesus and us, all of this accords with the prophetic word, "But the righteous one shall live by allegiance." (Rom. 1:16-17)

> In fact, a whole nexus of changes that were very much this-worldly were anticipated. As N. T. Wright puts it: "The kingdom of god," historically and theologically considered, is a slogan whose basic meaning is the hope that Israel's god is going to rule Israel (and the whole world), and that Caesar, or Herod, or anyone else of their ilk is not. It means that Torah [the law of Moses] will be fulfilled at last, that the Temple will be rebuilt and the Land cleansed. It does not necessarily mean a holy anarchy. . . . Rather, it means that Israel's god will rule her in the way he intends, through properly appointed persons and means. This will certainly mean (from the point of view of the Pharisees, Essenes, and anyone loosely described as Zealots) a change in the high priesthood. In some writings it also means a Messiah.

> This reinforces the basic point: the gospel proper is not in the first instance a story about human need for salvation but a story about Jesus's career, a career that culminates in his attainment of heavenly authority. The gospel story integrally involves Jesus's death for sins, but that is only part of the story, and the gospel narrative draws our eyes above all to Jesus's kingship.

> Properly speaking, pistis is not part of the gospel but the fitting response to the gospel. Moreover, our justification is not part of the content of the gospel proper either; only Jesus's justification is, inasmuch as the resurrection is the effect of his being declared righteous. Our justification is a result of the gospel when we are united by pistis to Jesus the atonement-making king.

> Jesus's reign is a nonnegotiable portion of the good news. First, when the gospel is presented today by a preacher or teacher, most of the time this "Jesus reigns" portion of the gospel is either entirely absent or mentioned as an aside. The cross and resurrection get central billing, but Jesus's kingship is tucked away offstage. We need to recover Jesus's kingship as a central, nonnegotiable constituent of the gospel. Jesus's reign as Lord of heaven and earth fundamentally determines the meaning of "faith" (pistis) as "allegiance" in relation to salvation. Jesus as king is the primary object toward which our saving "faith"-that is, our saving allegiance-is directed.

> But if Jesus has been raised from the dead, then where is he now? And what is he doing? It shouldn't surprise us if the answer proves to be fundamental to all aspects of Christian life today. Jesus is currently the enthroned king, Lord of heaven and earth, and he is actively ruling until, as Paul puts it in 1 Corinthians, "he has put all his enemies under his feet" (15:25). He is also serving in heaven as the great high priest who has offered his own blood as a redemption for our sins, so he is busy interceding on our behalf (Heb. 8:1-2; 9:11-12).

> That the four Gospels are intended to draw our eyes to the reign of God as accomplished through Jesus's enthronement is not an ordinary way of thinking about the Gospels today. They are usually read by the pious primarily through the imitatio Christi lens-that is, as fuel to foster the imitation of Jesus in daily life. But Wright makes a cogent and compelling case that all four Gospels, despite their various differences, in their own unique way contribute to this "how God became king" chorus.

> As Wright puts it, "The resurrection, in short, is presented by the evangelists not as a 'happy ending' after an increasingly sad and gloomy tale, but as the event that demonstrated that Jesus's execution really had dealt the deathblow to the dark forces that had stood in the way of God's new world, God's 'kingdom' of powerfully creative and restorative love, arriving 'on earth as in heaven.'"

> But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it-the righteousness of God through the allegiance of Jesus the Christ6 for all who give allegiance. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in the Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, through his allegiance.7 (Rom. 3:21-25) Therefore, since we have been justified by allegiance, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus the Christ. (Rom. 5:1) Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through the allegiance of Jesus the Christ,8 so we also have given allegiance to the Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by the allegiance of the Christ9 and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified. (Gal. 2:16) It is no longer I who live, but the Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by the allegiance of the Son of God,10 who loved me and gave himself for me. (Gal. 2:20) You are severed from the Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. For through the Spirit, by allegiance, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. For in the Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails for anything, but only allegiance working through love. (Gal. 5:4-6)

On his account I have suffered the loss of all things and consider them as rubbish, in order that I may gain the Christ and be found in him, not having my own righteousness by the law, but that which comes through the allegiance of the Christ,11 the righteousness of God based upon allegiance-that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death, that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead. (Phil. 3:8-11)

> When Paul speaks of Jesus Christ-and note that he does speak in this way every time Jesus is mentioned in all of the passages quoted above-Christ is not a last name or a meaningless addition; it is an honorific designation.12 It means Jesus the Messiah, Jesus the long-anticipated but now-ruling Jewish-style universal king. I cannot overstate the importance of this. In other words, Paul everywhere presupposes that the most basic identity of Jesus is that of the enthroned divine-human king, the actively ruling Son of God. So contextually the most obvious and natural way to speak about the proper relationship between the king and his people is allegiance or loyalty.

> nations. Paul's point is not that once we have a preestablished trust in Jesus's power to forgive our sins, then we are set free to do good works; rather it is that the gospel is that Jesus has been enthroned, so the only proper response is obedient allegiance to him as the king. It is true, however, that declaration of allegiance results in a forgiving release from the power of sin, so that it is possible to maintain allegiance by the Holy Spirit. The purpose of the gospel proclamation is to cultivate obedient allegiance to Jesus the king among the nations (cf. Rom. 15:18).

*Page 134 (Location 1939-1941)*

> If we synthesize the biblical data, we discover that saving allegiance includes three basic dimensions: mental affirmation that the gospel is true, professed fealty to Jesus alone as the cosmic Lord, and enacted loyalty through obedience to Jesus as the king.

> Through the phrase "lifted up," Jesus's crucifixion has intentionally been conflated by John with his exaltation to kingly rule, so that we can recognize the paradoxical glory-in-weakness. And when a glimpse of Jesus's glory is obtained, the one who has caught the glimmer is compelled to give pistis-that is, to affirm that the various strands of testimony about Jesus in John are true. This is not to say, however, that simply because intellectual assent is foregrounded for pistis in John, pistis in John is thereby devoid of a loyalty demand. For example, notice the way pistis and obedience can be paralleled: "Whoever has pistis in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him" (John 3:36).

---

*Page 139 (Location 2020-2024)*

> So, then, a few verses earlier, when we read the most famous salvation statement in the Bible, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever gives pistis unto him should not perish, but have eternal life" (John 3:16), we must bear in mind that although John frequently foregrounds mental affirmation, giving pistis unto Jesus is more than belief (mental assent), for in the final analysis giving pistis is bound up with obedience-enacted loyalty.

*Page 141 (Location 2046-2051)*

> In other words, Jesus's resurrection from the dead is both the most controversial and the most central historical "fact" that must be upheld, so Paul points to it as a way of compactly referencing the network of additional gospel facts that an affirmation of the resurrection entails by association. We should remember that all communication, but especially teaching, involves offering both compressed summary and expansive description at suitable times. By pointing to Jesus's resurrection from the dead as what is necessary to hold mentally as real, Paul is merely condensing the gospel facts that he elsewhere expands, evoking the larger gospel narrative by association.

> Public acknowledgement of the acceptance of Jesus's rule is the premier culminating act of pistis. The verb that Paul selects to describe what is necessary, homologeo, refers in this sort of context to a public declaration, as is made clear by the "with your mouth." Paul does not envision raising your hand in church or silently praying a prayer in your heart as a sufficient "confession" (nor does Paul say that such an action couldn't initiate salvation, but he clearly intends something more substantive). Paul is talking about something public and verbal, like what might happen at an ancient baptism-

*Page 143 (Location 2078-2090)*

> Moreover, in Matthew, Jesus himself indicates, in what is perhaps the most terrifying statement in the New Testament, that confessing that he is Lord is not on its own sufficient to secure eternal salvation. Allegiance includes obedient action: Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many powerful deeds in your name?" And then I will declare to them publicly, "I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness." (Matt. 7:21-23) The context in which this passage is situated pertains specifically to entering true life ("enter through the narrow gate!"-7:13), a warning against false prophets ("by their fruit you will recognize them!"-7:16), and the necessity of putting Jesus's words into practice ("everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock"-7:24). So the point in context is that even those who have confessed Jesus as Lord and who claim (on the basis of their own questionable testimony) to have performed good works in Jesus's name may not have truly enacted fidelity to Jesus as Lord. Notice Jesus calls them "workers of lawlessness," meaning their wicked practices are at issue. Professed allegiance is not sufficient; the allegiance must be realized by genuine, albeit not perfect, obedience. Pistis must be embodied. In fact, because salvation is a bodily journey, it cannot be any other way.
