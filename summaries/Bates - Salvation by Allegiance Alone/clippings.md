> The superficiality of American evangelicalism's gospel-obsession with security and assurance has led me at times to wonder if we should not teach justification by discipleship. Or justification by faithfulness. But Matthew Bates has landed on a beautiful and biblically sound term: allegiance. When Jesus first called the four disciples along the Sea of Galilee he didn't say "receive me into your heart" but "follow me."

> Moreover, when he finished the greatest sermon on earth, the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus didn't say "Repent and believe these things" but "the one who hears these words of mine and does them." So, too, the apostles Paul, Peter, and John called their listeners to a life swamped by the Spirit, a life of holiness amidst suffering, and a life of living in the light of love. These apostolic expressions are all condensed in this book into the term "allegiance." King Jesus summons people into a kingdom where he alone is king, and kings expect one thing from their subjects: allegiance.

> N. T. Wright offers a different example that helps us reconsider the first-century meaning of "believe" gospel language. Wright notes that the Jewish general Josephus, in his autobiographical recounting of the events of the Jewish-Roman war in AD 66, reports an incident where he urged a rebel leader to "repent and believe in me," using language nearly identical to what we find in the Gospel of Mark with respect to Jesus's proclamation, "The kingdom of God is near! Repent and believe the good news" (1:15).4 Our own cultural experiences might lead us to think that "repent" means to turn away from private sins such as adultery, greed, and exploitation. Meanwhile, in Christian circles "believe" is so often linked to Jesus and the forgiveness of sins that it may be hard to weigh what it means in this example featuring Josephus. But Wright's point is that Josephus was not trying to convince this rebel to turn away from private sins or to "believe" that God can forgive, rather Josephus wanted this man to join him in supporting the Jewish cause-that is, as I would put it, to show allegiance. So, what "repent and believe in me" means for Josephus in this context is "turn away from your present course of action and become loyal to me."

> 1. The true climax of the gospel-Jesus's enthronement-has generally been deemphasized or omitted from the gospel. 2. Consequently, pistis has been misaimed and inappropriately nuanced with respect to the gospel. It is regarded as "trust" in Jesus's righteousness alone or "faith" that Jesus's death covers my sins rather than "allegiance" to Jesus as king. 3. Final salvation is not about attainment of heaven but about embodied participation in the new creation. When the true goal of salvation is recognized, terms such as "faith," "works," "righteousness," and "the gospel" can be more accurately reframed. 4. Once it is agreed that salvation is by allegiance alone, matters that have traditionally divided Catholics and Protestants-the essence of the gospel, faith alone versus works, declared righteousness versus infused righteousness-are reconfigured in ways that may prove helpful for reconciliation.

> We are not to leap out in the dark at a whim, or simply to prove to ourselves, God, or others that we "have faith." But the promise-keeping God might indeed call us to act on invisible realities of his heavenly kingdom. If the call is genuine, we may indeed be bruised by the leap. Yet if it is genuine, in gathering the bruises from the hard landing, we can be certain that we will come to look more like the wounded Son, which is the final goal of redeemed humanity.

> The true thrust of Paul's line of thought is that the resurrection served to trigger the exaltation of Jesus from his lowly status among the dead, so that he came to be installed in a position of sovereign authority. Previously he was the Son of God; now he is the Son-of-God-in-Power, actively reigning until all his enemies are made a footstool for his feet (1 Cor. 15:25). In other words, in his earthly life Jesus was the anointed one, the one chosen as the royal Davidic Messiah (the Christ), but during his earthly sojourn he had not yet received his throne, he had not yet begun to reign as king. But the resurrection (and ascension) changed all this, as Jesus has now been enthroned at the right hand of God and is reigning as the Lord of heaven and earth. In fact, in summing up his presentation of the basic content of the gospel, Paul concludes by calling this Son-of-God-in-Power by slightly different titles that Paul prefers, "Jesus the Christ our Lord" (Rom. 1:4).

> For example, in both Romans 1:3 and Philippians 2:9 the normal verb for birth, gennao, is passed over in favor of ginomai, a term that can mean ordinary birth but much more often stresses change in status or existence.

> That Jesus died for our sins and, as a portion of that "our," that he also died for my sins is truly part of the gospel-emphatically so!-but it is imperative to realize that it is only a small but vital portion of the gospel as properly understood, not the whole gospel. It is also critical to recognize that "faith" is not primarily aimed at trusting in the forgiveness-of-sins process. For Paul does not primarily call us to "faith" ("belief" or "trust") in some sort of atonement system in order to be saved (although mental affirmation that Jesus died for our sins is necessary), but rather to "faith" ("allegiance") unto Jesus as Lord.

> enemies are fully subjected (1 Cor. 15:20-28; Eph. 1:18-23). The world is genuinely different since Jesus defeated his enemies and started to rule actively. The subjective aspect of this good news is that for it to be personally effective, this saving power must be actualized by pistis-which is part of Paul's point in Romans 1:16-17. So the main idea in Romans 1:16-17 is that the gospel is a transformative story because it reveals "the righteousness of God"-that is, the resurrection-effecting verdict that God rendered over Jesus the king and that resulted in our ability to share his resurrection life as a gift from God.
