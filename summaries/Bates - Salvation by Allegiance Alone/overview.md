In Salvation by Allegiance Alone, Matthew W. Bates presents a provocative reassessment of salvation, challenging conventional Christian understandings of faith. He argues that contemporary interpretations of faith—often reduced to mere belief—are inadequate; instead, he posits that faith should be understood as allegiance to Jesus as King. This work seeks to bridge the theological divide between Catholics and Protestants, advocating for a more holistic, allegiance-based understanding of salvation and its implications for Christian living.

Bates meticulously examines the Greek term pistis (commonly translated as "faith") and demonstrates that it encompasses a richer range of meanings, including loyalty and fidelity. He breaks down the implications of this understanding for concepts like justification, resurrection, and the nature of conversion, urging believers to reflect on their commitment to follow and obey Christ. The book is structured into nine chapters, each contributing to a comprehensive framework that reshapes how faith, works, and salvation are understood in light of Jesus' kingship.
