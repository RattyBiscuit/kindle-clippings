## Chapter Summaries

### Part 1: Ancient Worldviews

-   Introduction to Egyptian, Mesopotamian and early Israelite cosmologies, demonstrating shared assumptions about a flat earth, primal sea and heavenly dome.
-   Sets the stage for understanding how biblical writers borrowed and transformed these motifs to articulate Israel’s distinctive monotheism.

### Part 2: Earth, Sea and Underworld

-   Examination of the three “zones” on which Scripture focuses: the dry land as God’s ordered creation, the chaotic sea depicted in myths of Leviathan, and Sheol/Hades as the realm of the dead.
-   Highlights parallels with Canaanite and Mesopotamian myths while showing how Israel reinterprets divine combat and chaos motifs to point towards new creation and salvation.

### Part 3: Heaven and Temple

-   Exploration of the firmament, celestial lights and heavenly palace imagery, revealing how the sky-dome symbolised God’s enthronement.
-   Analysis of the Jerusalem temple as a microcosm of the wider cosmos: its courts, veil and Holy of Holies mirror layers of creation and God’s presence at the universe’s centre.

### Part 4: Theological Reflections

-   Investigation of the ascension narratives and their dependence on ancient cosmological assumptions.
-   Discussion of Christian Platonism, the Creator-creation distinction, and implications for how believers today should integrate scientific discovery with the Bible’s sacred imagination.
-   Concludes with suggestions for reclaiming the Bible’s cosmic vision as both strange and deeply relevant to contemporary faith.
