N. T. Wrightâ€™s volume offers a sweeping introduction to first-century Judaism and the emergence of the New Testament, arguing that to understand the early Christian movement one must reconstruct its Jewish and Greco-Roman contexts. He sets out both the historical background of Palestinian Judaism - its social makeup, religious hopes, and worldview - and the hermeneutical principles required to read the New Testament on its own terms. Wright positions this work as the opening instalment in a multi-volume project on Jesus, Paul and the formation of the New Testament canon, aiming to address substantial historical and theological questions rather than provide only sketch-level overviews.
