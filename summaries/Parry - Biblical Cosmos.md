# Summary

The Biblical Cosmos invites readers to journey through the world as the ancient authors of Scripture perceived it, showing that the biblical writers shared the flat-earth and dome-sky cosmologies of their Near Eastern neighbours. Robin A. Parry unpacks this “weird and wonderful” worldview in four parts, tracing how each zone of earth, sea, underworld, heavens and temple functioned as theological theatre in which God enacted creation, judgment and redemption.

Rather than dismiss the Bible’s ancient cosmology as mere superstition, Parry argues it remains a rich resource for modern faith. He moves from a descriptive tour of first-century cosmological assumptions to reflections on what they mean for contemporary believers - addressing issues such as the ascension of Christ, the relationship of science and faith, and a revived Christian Platonism that honours God as the essence of all things.

# Chapter Summaries

## Part 1: Ancient Worldviews

-   Introduction to Egyptian, Mesopotamian and early Israelite cosmologies, demonstrating shared assumptions about a flat earth, primal sea and heavenly dome.
-   Sets the stage for understanding how biblical writers borrowed and transformed these motifs to articulate Israel’s distinctive monotheism.

## Part 2: Earth, Sea and Underworld

-   Examination of the three “zones” on which Scripture focuses: the dry land as God’s ordered creation, the chaotic sea depicted in myths of Leviathan, and Sheol/Hades as the realm of the dead.
-   Highlights parallels with Canaanite and Mesopotamian myths while showing how Israel reinterprets divine combat and chaos motifs to point towards new creation and salvation.

## Part 3: Heaven and Temple

-   Exploration of the firmament, celestial lights and heavenly palace imagery, revealing how the sky-dome symbolised God’s enthronement.
-   Analysis of the Jerusalem temple as a microcosm of the wider cosmos: its courts, veil and Holy of Holies mirror layers of creation and God’s presence at the universe’s centre.

## Part 4: Theological Reflections

-   Investigation of the ascension narratives and their dependence on ancient cosmological assumptions.
-   Discussion of Christian Platonism, the Creator-creation distinction, and implications for how believers today should integrate scientific discovery with the Bible’s sacred imagination.
-   Concludes with suggestions for reclaiming the Bible’s cosmic vision as both strange and deeply relevant to contemporary faith.
