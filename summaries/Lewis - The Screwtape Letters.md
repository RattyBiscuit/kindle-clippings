## Chapter Summaries

- Preface: Lewis claims to have discovered Screwtape’s letters but refuses to explain their provenance, warning readers that they present a devil’s perspective and should not be taken at face value.
    
- Letter 1: Screwtape counsels Wormwood on how best to seduce “the Patient” by distracting him with trivialities and preventing him from perceiving moral truths clearly.
    
- Letter 2: The Patient becomes a Christian, much to Screwtape’s annoyance, and Wormwood is chastised for allowing his charge to embrace faith; Screwtape urges exploitation of the Patient’s imperfect grasp of Christianity to undermine his belief.
    
- Letter 3: Screwtape advises keeping the Patient’s faith from altering his everyday behaviour by encouraging a purely internalised spirituality divorced from communal practice.
    
- Letter 4: Guidance is given on using the Patient’s inexperience in prayer to instil doubt and transform prayer into dry ritual rather than genuine communion with God.
    
- Letters 5-7: Screwtape outlines how to use the suffering and uncertainty of World War II to erode virtue - exploiting fear and grief - while warning that war can also prompt moral reflection and deeper faith.
    
- Letter 8: Screwtape explains the advantage of exploiting the Patient’s emotional swings, showing how spiritual “highs” and “lows” can be turned to the devils’ favour.
    
- Letter 10: Upon learning the Patient has formed new, non-Christian friendships, Screwtape encourages Wormwood to foster hypocrisy by magnifying the Patient’s sense of superiority both over Christians and non-Christians alike.
    
- Letter 13: The Patient experiences a second, deeper conversion - perceived by the devils as a “barrier of fog” - which frustrates Wormwood’s efforts and strengthens the Patient’s resolve.
    
- Letter 14: Advice is given on attacking the Patient’s humility by tempting him with a craving for social approval and reputation.
    
- Letter 15: The current lull in warfare is to be used to draw the Patient into dwelling on past regrets or future anxieties, keeping him from present-minded trust in God.
    
- Letters 17-21: Screwtape teaches methods to pervert the Patient’s virtues - turning temperance into fussiness, and love into mere appetite or lust - and warns against conflating love with solely physical attraction.
    
- Letter 22: The Patient falls genuinely in love with a Christian woman, an outcome Screwtape fears will solidify the Patient’s faith rather than weaken it.
    
- Letters 23-25: Counsel is given on corrupting the Patient’s growing Christian character, including exploiting his desire for novelty (“the Same Old Thing”) and misdirecting his charitable impulses.
    
- Letters 26-27: Screwtape outlines how to misuse the Patient’s affection and sympathy for the Woman - turning genuine concern into self-centred pity or meddling control.
    
- Letter 28: Wormwood is warned to keep the Patient alive at all costs, since the Patient’s death in his current state would mean certain damnation for the devils’ cause and salvation for the Patient.
    
- Letter 29: Instructions on using the bombing raids on the Patient’s town to amplify his fear, cowardice and bitterness without driving him to genuine prayer for courage.
    
- Letter 30: The Patient carries out his duty under fire; Screwtape notes that his perseverance, despite terror, keeps him humble and close to God, thwarting demonic plans.
    
- Letter 31: The Patient dies heroically in a raid, and his soul is received into Heaven; Wormwood is summoned back to Hell to answer for his failure, underscoring the novel’s ultimate affirmation of divine grace and victory over evil.
