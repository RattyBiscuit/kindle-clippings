This idea of the stars as God’s heavenly army fighting for Israel is also found in the vision in Dan 8:1–14, which depicts the empire of Alexander the Great as a goat with a horn (Alexander). The horn is broken off and is replaced by fours horns (Alexander’s four generals who divided his empire after his death). The vision focuses on a “little horn” descended from one of the four horns. This is Antiochus IV, the arch opponent of Israel and Israel’s God: “Out of one of [the goat’s four horns] came a little horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the glorious land. It grew great, even to the host of heaven. And some of the host and some of the stars it threw down to the ground and trampled on them” (Dan 8:9–10). Here Antiochus’ opposition to Israel is presented as a battle against “the host/army of heaven.” And he has some measure of success—some of the stars (i.e., the heavenly army) are thrown to the ground and trampled.221 We seem to be presented with a vision that highlights the heavenly dimension of Antiochus’ earthly conflict against the temple in Jerusalem. The attack on Jerusalem’s temple was an assault on the very stars of heaven, on the divine council itself. Of course, this is a symbolic vision, but it is of interest because it reveals the continuing influence of the ancient association of stars and heavenly beings.

Many scholars have suggested that the cosmos in Genesis 1 is being portrayed as a cosmic temple. The use of the term māôr for sun, moon, and stars may be a deliberate allusion to the “lamps” in the tabernacle.

Many scholars have suggested that the cosmos in Genesis 1 is being portrayed as a cosmic temple. The use of the term māôr for sun, moon, and stars may be a deliberate allusion to the “lamps” in the tabernacle. Every other occurrence of the word māôr in the Torah refers to the lamps in Israel’s tent of meeting.

There are two or three stories in the Old Testament in which readers are given a sneak glimpse into the divine council chamber. In the first, the prophet Micaiah is brought before Ahab, king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, to speak a word from God concerning whether they should join forces and go into battle against the Syrians. All the other prophets had said that the Lord supported such a plan. Micaiah also said, “Go up and triumph; Jehovah will give [Ramoth-gilead] into the hand of the king” (1 Kgs 22:15). Ahab suspects a lie—for this prophet has a reputation for prophesying only bad news for the king—and he presses Micaiah who then switches his message and proclaims coming defeat. Now prophets were people who had been granted access in the Spirit to the divine council and were thus authorized to speak in the name of Jehovah.256 At this point in the story Micaiah gives what is possibly the only biblical account from a prophet of his visionary experience of standing in the divine council:257 And Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left; and Jehovah said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one said one thing, and another said another. Then a spirit came forward and stood before Jehovah, saying, ‘I will entice him.’ And Jehovah said to him, ‘By what means?’ And he said, ‘I will go out, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so.’ Now therefore

behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; Jehovah has declared disaster for you.” (1 Kgs 22:19–23)

The second story is from the prologue to the book of Job. There we have a scene set in heaven. It was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah. Among them was a member of the court who is called the satan (hassātān). “The satan” is not a name like “Bob” (or Satan) but a job title like “the builder.” It means the accuser. The role of the accuser in the council seems to be some kind of testing role. He wanders throughout the earth and instigates trials that test the quality and truth of various people. In the prologue we see a conversation between the accuser and Jehovah about a righteous man called Job. The accuser suspects that Job’s devotion to God is skin deep; anyone with such a blessed life could seem so righteous. But take away some of the benefits and his true colors would show. God grants him permission to do just this. So the accuser leaves God’s presence and returns to earth where he causes a series of calamities to befall Job; yet Job does not curse God. At the next meeting of the divine council, the accuser returns to heaven and argues that stronger tests of Job’s integrity are required. He is given permission to carry out these tests too. The character of the accuser is ambiguous in the Bible. In the book of Job he is a member of God’s council and seems to play a constructive, albeit unpleasant, role in God’s governance of the cosmos. In the prophet Zechariah he seems to play a similar role, accusing Joshua the high priest, although there he is rebuked by the angel of Jehovah.

council? A case can be made that they seem to be assigned governance by Jehovah over the seventy nations of the biblical world. Recall that there were seventy sons of El, the chief god, in the Canaanite divine council. In biblical literature, these seventy “gods” are assigned to rule the seventy nations. This we infer from the following: The table of nations in Genesis 10 lists seventy nations and, according to Deut 32:8, the number of nations is fixed according to the number of the “sons of God”: “When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he divided mankind, he fixed the borders of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God.” This suggestion is reinforced by Psalm 82 in which the sons of God are berated by God for not “doing justice” in the nations. Daniel 10, with its references to the heavenly rulers of Greece and Persia, may also fit with this idea. The heavenly princes of Greece and Persia in Daniel 10 may have been thought of as members of the divine council.

What else can we say about this elusive divine council? A case can be made that they seem to be assigned governance by Jehovah over the seventy nations of the biblical world.

Ezekiel thought that the garden paradise of Eden was located on a holy mountain.295 This reflects the close association of temples with both mountains and gardens. Eden itself is presented in Genesis as a garden temple—a lush paradise (containing a life-giving tree) in which God dwelt and fellowshipped with human beings.

He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever. (Ps 78:69) In this psalm God is pictured as the one who built his own house306 (in the ANE gods were often spoken of as the founders and builders of their temples), but what is interesting is that this house is compared to creation. This is no accident but is fundamental to the symbolism of the temple, for the temple is a model of the universe. As Josephus said regarding the items of the tabernacle: “Every one of these objects is intended to recall and represent the nature of the universe” (Ant. 3:180). Different scholars have worked out the details of the comparison differently, but the proposal I find most convincing is the following: (a) the outer court corresponds to the terrestrial sphere of earth and sea, (b) the holy place represents the sky, and (c) the holy of holies stands for God’s heaven itself.

The book of Genesis taught that humans are the pinnacle of creation and, as icons of God, rule over creation on behalf of God. The fate of creation was thereby linked to the fate of human beings. Humanity out of sync with God has creation-wide implications, and humanity liberated likewise ushers in the liberation of all creation.341 Humans were representatives of creation. In the thought of the early Christ-followers Jesus was a Second Adam—a human as God intended humans to be.342 And this Second Adam succeeded where the first Adam had failed. As the true human, the true Adam, Jesus represented all humanity, but as such he also represented the whole universe.343 His resurrection was thus the resurrection of all humanity and of all creation. In biblical language the resurrection is “new creation.” Thus when New Testament authors speak of the salvation of people and of the cosmos they think of it in terms of new creation; that is, being united with Jesus and sharing in his resurrection life.

The book of Exodus helpfully alerts us to the care needed interpreting language about God. Chapter 33 tells us that “Jehovah used to speak with Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend” (Exod 33:11), but in the conversation between the Lord and Moses that immediately follows this comment, God says, “You cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live” (Exod 33:20). This was no careless oversight on the part of the book’s final editor. Rather, the text is flagging up that language about God should not be read in a naïve way. Scripture can talk about God as if he has a body but it does not follow that such talk can be taken at face value (please excuse yet another terrible pun). Thus, in the tradition, both heaven and its inhabitants fill up no space at all.368 An analogy

When we employ physical metaphors to describe or allude to a spiritual reality—and light is one of the most popular metaphors the world over—we tend to think of the physical referent as the most real of the two. In reality, the spiritual is higher in the scale of reality, and physical light is nothing but a shadow of God’s intelligible self-communication. The true light, the light of heaven, is the archetype of which the light of the stars, and the light of torches and candles, the light that we can measure and manipulate, is a participating symbol.387

Biblical authors were also well aware of just how astonishing it was, in light of the awesome heavens, that God should see such importance in life on earth. The psalmist stands in amazement: “when I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, what is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?”391 Why should the God of the stars care for such apparently insignificant creatures? Yet, the psalmist affirms, God does care. If anything, modern cosmology does not smash that hope but amplifies it enormously! To pray Psalm 8 now is to consider the heavens even more mind-boggling than the psalmist could have ever imagined.
